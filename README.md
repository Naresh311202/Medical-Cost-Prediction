# Medical Cost Prediction using Linear and Random Forest Models

## Description:

In the pursuit of enhancing healthcare cost management and planning, the Medical Cost Prediction project was undertaken, aiming to predict medical expenses for patients using two distinct machine learning models: Linear Regression and Random Forest. Leveraging a dataset containing key patient attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, and other relevant factors, the project sought to provide accurate estimations of medical costs.

## Key Features:

* Linear Model Approach: The initial phase of the project involved implementing a Linear Regression model to predict medical costs based on patient characteristics. Through meticulous feature engineering and model optimization, an accuracy of 73% was achieved, providing a solid foundation for cost prediction.

* Random Forest Model Enhancement: To further improve prediction accuracy, an alternative approach using the Random Forest algorithm was explored. By harnessing the power of ensemble learning and decision trees, the Random Forest model delivered a remarkable accuracy of 82%, surpassing the performance of the linear model.

* Evaluation and Comparison: Through rigorous evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared, the performance of both models was assessed and compared. The Random Forest model demonstrated superior predictive capabilities, showcasing its effectiveness in medical cost estimation.

* Interpretability and Insights: Utilizing feature importance analysis provided by the Random Forest model, key factors influencing medical costs were identified. Insights gleaned from the model shed light on the significant contributors to healthcare expenses, facilitating informed decision-making for healthcare providers and policymakers.

## Benefits:

Accurate Cost Estimation: The project facilitates precise estimation of medical expenses, aiding healthcare organizations, insurance companies, and individuals in financial planning and resource allocation.
Model Comparison: By comparing the performance of linear and tree-based models, the project highlights the advantages of ensemble learning techniques in healthcare cost prediction, paving the way for future research and model refinement.
Insightful Analysis: The project offers valuable insights into the factors driving healthcare costs, empowering stakeholders to address cost drivers and optimize healthcare delivery and resource utilization.

## Technologies Used:
